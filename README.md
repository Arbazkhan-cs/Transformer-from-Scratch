# English-to-Hindi Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model built from scratch for English-to-Hindi translation. The model is based on the original Transformer architecture introduced in the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* by Vaswani et al.

## Project Structure

## Features
- Implements a Transformer model from scratch
- Uses self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence learning
- Translates English text to Hindi

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install torch numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/english-to-hindi-transformer.git
   cd english-to-hindi-transformer
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook English_to_Hindi.ipynb
   ```

3. Modify `transformer.py` to tweak the model architecture if needed.

## Dataset
You will need a parallel dataset of English-Hindi sentence pairs for training. You can use datasets like:
- [AI4Bharat's Hindi-English Corpus](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/)
- [Opus](https://opus.nlpl.eu/)

Ensure the dataset is preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

## Future Improvements
- Implement beam search for better translation quality
- Add support for larger datasets with efficient training
- Experiment with different tokenization techniques (e.g., SentencePiece, BPE)
